# dotfiles

This repository contains my personal **Linux** dot config files (dotfiles).

These files are configured to work together for a consistent and efficient workflow. While they can be used as a reference or starting point for your own setup, some adjustments may be necessary on other systems.

- `ranger` – terminal file manager
- `mpd` – music player daemon configuration
- `rmpc` – terminal MPD client with Catppuccin Mocha theme
- `picom` – compositor for transparency and visual effects
