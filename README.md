# dotfiles

These are my personal **Linux** dotfiles - a collection of configuration files. 
You're welcome to use them as a reference or starting point for your own setup.

## Design philosophy

A minimalistic, modern system built for efficiency and speed to support a streamlined workflow.
All components are configured to work together as a cohesive, distraction-free environment, keeping the interface clean and focused.
